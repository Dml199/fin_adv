    "article": "AMSTERDAM, June 7 (Reuters) - The boom in artificial intelligence will increase banks' dependence on big U.S. tech firms, creating new risks for the industry, European banking executives said.Excitement around using artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services - widely used already for detecting fraud and money-laundering - has soared since the launch of OpenAI's viral chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 as banks examine ways to deploy generative AI.But at a gathering of fintech executives in Amsterdam this week, some expressed concerns that the amount of computing power needed to develop AI capabilities would make banks rely even more on small number of tech providers.ING's (INGA.AS)New Tab, opens new tab chief analytics officer, Bahadir Yilmaz, who is in charge of the Dutch bank's AI work, told Reuters he expected to rely on Big Tech companies \"more and more going forward\", for infrastructure and machinery.\"You will always need them because sometimes the machine power that is needed for these technologies is huge. It's also not really feasible for a bank to build this tech,\" he said.Banks' dependency on a small number of tech companies was \"one of the biggest risks\", ING's Yilmaz said, emphasising that European banks in particular needed to ensure they could move between different tech providers and avoid what he called \"vendor lock-in\".Britain last year proposed rules to regulate financial firms' heavy reliance on external technology companies, such as Microsoft, Google, IBM and Amazon. Regulators are worried that problems at a single cloud computing company could potentially bring down services across many financial institutions.\"AI requires huge amounts of compute and really the only way that you're going to be able to access that compute (computing power) sensibly is from Big Tech,\" Joanne Hannaford, who leads technology strategy at Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE)New Tab, opens new tab corporate bank, told an audience at the Money20/20 conference earlier this week.Hannaford said that there are requirements for the bank to notify regulators when they move data into the cloud, which could become much more complicated as the use of cloud computing increases.Banks also need to communicate to regulators the risk of not leveraging cloud computing’s power, which would be an opportunity cost, she added.AI was top of the agenda at the Amsterdam conference.The CEO of French AI startup Mistral AI, seen as France's answer to OpenAI, told attendees there were \"synergies\" between its GenAI products and financial services.\"We see a lot of opportunities in creating analysis and monitoring information ... which is really something that bankers like to do,\" Arthur Mensch said.ING is testing an AI chatbot currently used for 2.5% of incoming customer service chats. Asked how long it would be until the chatbot could handle half or more of customer service conversations, Yilmaz said within a year.In its first statement on AI, the European Union's securities watchdog said last week that banks and investment firms cannot shirk boardroom responsibility and have a legal obligation to protect customers when using AI. It warned that the technology is likely to have significant impact on retail investor protection."

    "article": "NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - A host of U.S. companies are faced with a problem they had not expected to confront this year: a rising dollar.Many market participants believed the dollar would fall on the back of interest rate cuts that both investors and the Federal Reserve had penciled in for 2024. Those cuts are yet to come, and the U.S. dollar index (.DXY)New Tab, opens new tab, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of currencies, is up 4% in 2024 and has climbed about 16% in the last three years.While those gains reflect the relative strength of the U.S. economy, a rising dollar can be a problem for some companies. A strong U.S. currency makes it more expensive for multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars, while also hurting the competitiveness of exporters' products. Companies guarding against dollar strength must also devote resources to hedging strategies that offset the effects of the rising currency on their bottom lines.All told, every 10% year over year rise in the dollar shaves some 3% from S&P 500 earnings, according to estimates from BofA Global Research.The dollar's strength in the latest quarter comes during a period of robust corporate profits. With well over 80% of the S&P 500 having reported first quarter results, companies are on track to have increased earnings by 7.8%, up from an expectation of 5.1% growth in April, according to LSEG IBES. Nonetheless, companies from Apple Inc (AAPL.O)New Tab, opens new tab and IBM (IBM.N)New Tab, opens new tab to Procter & Gamble(PG.N)New Tab, opens new tab have mentioned foreign exchange as a headwind.The strong dollar \"has caused a lot of consternation,\" said Andrew Gage, senior vice president at treasury and finance solutions firm Kyriba. \"CFOs are asking their treasury teams to be much more diligent in managing the risk that comes from that strong dollar.\"The dollar’s gains are being fueled by U.S. economic strength, which is eroding expectations for how deeply the Fed will be able to cut rates this year. Investors are pricing in around 50 basis points of rate cuts for 2024, compared to more than 150 basis points forecast at the beginning of the year, futures markets show.Yields in the U.S. stand above those in many other economies as a result, bolstering the dollar's appeal over other currencies.\"Nearly all FX practitioners were expecting the dollar to be weaker this year with the anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates,\" said Amo Sahota, director at foreign exchange risk management firm Klarity FX in San Francisco. \"Corporates were licking their lips, essentially waiting for that to play through.\"Not all S&P 500 companies are equally affected by the dollar's swings. The information technology, materials and communication services sectors top the list with the most international revenue exposure, garnering as much as 57%, 52% and 48% of their total revenue respectively from abroad, data from FactSet showed.In the latest quarter, Coca-Cola (KO.N)New Tab, opens new tab reported a 9% currency headwind, noting it was driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Conglomerate 3M (MMM.N)New Tab, opens new tab said foreign currency negatively impacted adjusted margins by a larger-than-expected 0.6 percentage points, while Apple called out nearly four percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange on its quarterly revenue.To prevent exchange rate moves creating big swings in earnings, businesses use various hedging strategies including those that employ forward and options contracts.Some firms that advise companies on managing FX risk noted a rise in hedging activity in recent weeks, though quieter currency markets have made hedging a less urgent issue for some companies even as the dollar has risen. In March, Deutsche Bank’s index of currency volatility (.DBCVIX)New Tab, opens new tab fell to its lowest level since September 2021.\"Towards the end of the first quarter, we did see some complacency on the hedging front. Currency volatility fell to a multi-year low, which led to a lack of a sense of urgency,\" said John Doyle, head of trading and dealing at Monex USA in Washington. \"However, we have seen a recent uptick in hedging over the past month and a half.\"Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at payments company Corpay, said the subdued level of currency volatility may be making some companies \"almost too complacent about the risks they are facing.\"Analysts at BofA Global Research said that while they believe the dollar will eventually weaken over the medium term, “the turning point has become harder to time.”\"The case to hedge USD upside risks for the rest of the year has materially grown for U.S. corporates,\" they said."

    "article": "NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - As markets dial down expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts this year, America's largest corporations are poised to rely more heavily on their stock and a bulging cash hoard instead of expensive debt to finance acquisitions.Since the start of 2023, the volume of mergers and acquisitions financed by stock or a mix of cash and stock has touched its highest level in more than two decades, according to data from LSEG.All-stock M&A transactions accounted for $263.6 billion, or about 24% of overall announced volumes so far this year - the highest percentage year-to-date since 2001 when the comparable figure was 47.2%, according to LSEG.Cash-and-stock deals have accounted for 10.8% of total announced transaction volumes this year, which is the highest level since year-to-date 2021 when the figure was 17.5%. Put together, all-stock M&A volumes, including the common stock value of cash-and-stock transactions, has accounted for roughly 29% of total deal volumes so far this year - the highest percentage since 2001 when the figure was 30.7%.Several investment bankers, deal lawyers, and Wall Street analysts expect this funding strategy to gather pace this year, as hopes of near-term interest rate cuts fade and debt borrowing costs are expected to remain higher for longer.\"When corporates feel good about their currencies, they tend to use stock for deals - and at the same time, they don't want to get over-leveraged (by taking on debt),\" said Ivan Farman, co-head of global M&A at Bank of America.\"People are being a little more cautious about how they approach their capital structures,\" he added.Since the start of 2023, all-stock mergers have accounted for 19.5% of overall volumes - the prior ten-year average of all-stock M&A deals as a percentage of overall volumes is 14.8%, according to LSEG.Notable stock deals this year including Capital One's (COF.N)New Tab, opens new tab $35 billion takeover of credit card rival Discover Financial (DFS.N)New Tab, opens new tab; Diamondback Energy's (FANG.O)New Tab, opens new tab $26 billion acquisition of Endeavor Energy that was mostly funded with stock; and BlackRock's (BLK.N)New Tab, opens new tab $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners that was also funded primarily with stock.The trend has continued with companies showing an inclination to use cash and stock for acquisitions.In April, IBM (IBM.N)New Tab, opens new tab said it will acquire HashiCorp (HCP.O)New Tab, opens new tab for $6.4 billion using cash on hand and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX)New Tab, opens new tab made an all-stock bid to acquire Anglo American (AAL.L)New Tab, opens new tab that was rejected.As opportunistic buyers have aggressively pursued targets whose share price has nosedived, they have often used stock as acquisition currency to bridge differences on valuation with sellers.\"From the seller's perspective, a stock deal is a sharing of the value creation from synergies - and if it's a cash deal, you're cashing your shareholders out at a specific price for a specific premium,\" said Mark McMaster, global head of M&A at Lazard.\"For some of these strategic combinations, it's easier or more compelling to offer stock, because it represents a combination, and a true sharing of the synergies amongst the buyer and seller,\" added McMaster.Overall M&A volumes are expected to rise 50% in 2024, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a March report, largely due to pent-up demand from last year when volumes touched a decade-low.But expectations of how they will be financed has taken a sharp U-turn from earlier in the year as some investors are pricing in just one or two U.S. rate cuts this year compared to three.So far this year, investment-grade rated companies raised nearly $71 billion of debt to fund M&A transactions at a faster pace than the last three years, according to Informa Global Markets data.This tally was expected to touch $175 billion to $200 billion by the end of the year but now only another $60-70 billion of known transactions are expected to be funded in the debt markets this year, said Scott Schulte, head of U.S. investment-grade syndicate desk at Barclays Capital.It would take the total amount raised for mergers in 2024 above 2022 and 2023 levels but below the $173 billion in 2021, according to Informa data.Investment-grade companies may still take on debt but it could be bonds with greater prepayment flexibility like term, bridge loans and commercial paper with far shorter maturities, said Schulte.For private equity firms, exiting highly leveraged transactions in this higher-for-longer environment would eat into their total returns, said Ruth Yang, global head of private market analytics at S&P Global Ratings.Leveraging up would increase rating downgrade risk so they could use cash and stock for any acquisitions, she added.Global listed non-financial corporations currently hold $5.6 trillion in cash on their balance sheets, while the biggest private market investors have $2.5 trillion of dry powder at their disposal for dealmaking, according to the Morgan Stanley report.Companies may prefer smaller strategic transactions via “bolt-ons” or divestitures, with the former funded with cash or stock, said Edward Marrinan, credit strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\"Higher borrowing costs, a stringent regulatory environment and the trend toward de-globalization leaves many companies more cautious about undertaking large transformative acquisitions,\" said Marrinan."

BMC's lawsuit in Houston federal court accused IBM of breaching their contract when AT&T abandoned its software for IBM's.Tuesday's ruling overturned U.S. District Judge Gray Miller's 2022 decision that IBM owed BMC $1.6 billion in damages for breaking their agreement. Miller said IBM had already secretly agreed to replace BMC's software at AT&T when it negotiated the contract in 2015."

Revenue per vehicle plunged 5% from year ago.But perhaps reflecting the extent of short-selling that fed this year's 42%-plus stock drop up to Tuesday's close, shares surged once the report was released after the bell - ostensibly cheered by somewhat vague plans to introduce low-cost \"new models\" by early 2025 and boss Elon Musk's update.More buoyant tech stocks (.NYFANG)New Tab, opens new tab generally helped as the megacaps shape up to report their quarterlies through this week and next. The S&P500 (.SPX)New Tab, opens new tab at large clocked a second straight day of gains on Tuesday, which saw the index recover more than a third of the near-6% peak-to-trough slide this month.Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META.O)New Tab, opens new tab, one the big winners from the artificial intelligence boom of the past 18 months and whose stock is still up more than 40% this year, reports after the market close on Wednesday.In the background, the U.S. Senate voted by a wide margin late Tuesday in favor of legislation that would ban TikTok in the United States if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year. The move ups the ante in the increasingly tense U.S.-China tech standoff.The four-year battle over TikTok, which is used by 170 million people in the United States, is just one front in a war over the internet and technology between Washington and Beijing.

Those quantum machines could make feasible scientific calculations that would otherwise take millions of years with today's classical computers.But the fundamental unit of quantum computers - called a \"qubit\" - is fast but finicky, producing data errors if the quantum computer is even slightly disturbed. To solve that problem, quantum researchers often build more physical qubits than needed and use error-correction techniques to yield a smaller number of reliable and useful qubits.Microsoft and Quantinuum said they had made a breakthrough in that field. Microsoft applied an error-correction algorithm that it wrote to Quantinuum's physical qubits, yielding about four reliable qubits from 30 physical ones.Jason Zander, Microsoft's executive vice president for strategic missions and technologies, said the company believes that is the best ratio of reliable qubits from a quantum chip that has ever been shown.\"We ran more than 14,000 individual experiments without a single error. That's up to 800 times better than anything on record,\" Zander told Reuters in an interview.Microsoft said it plans to release the technology to its cloud computing customers in the coming months.Quantum researchers, both at Quantinuum and its rivals, often cite a figure of about 100 reliable qubits as the number needed to beat a conventional supercomputer. Neither Microsoft nor Quantinuum on Wednesday would say how many more years they will need to use the new technique to hit 100 reliable qubits.But Ilyas Khan, the chief product officer of Quantinuum, said, \"The current view is that we have lopped at least two years off that, if not more.\""

But its prospects for success are viewed with scepticism by many in the industry.\"I don't doubt TSMC will be dominant, but Japan will seek to prove that they are valid as a number two,\" said Macquarie's Thong.($1 = 150.3100 yen)"
